this application can be used for front ends front edn interface its really a very low version of what all that can be added to make it really more  user friendly 
 a bit why i chooses what i choose-
 Visual Design as u can see uses 
Modern gradient background creates an engaging, professional appearance
Clean white card layout provides focus and readability
Responsive design ensures functionality across all device sizes
Smooth hover animations enhance user experience

User Experienceiis better by 
Form validation prevents empty submissions
Loading states provide feedback during API calls
Success/error messages keep users informed
Date validation prevents past dates from being selected
Accessible form labels improve usability

Technical Implementation:
Single-page application for simplicity and fast loading
Async/await for clean API handling
Error handling for network failures
JSON data structure matching API requirements
